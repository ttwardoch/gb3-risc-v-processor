# gb3-risc-v-processor
Repository for IIA project with a goal of optimising the RV32I 32-bit integer variant of the RISC-V instruction set architecture(ISA) in terms of power usage, performance and resource usage.

Intended learning outcomes and objectives:

• Understand the key concepts of computer architecture, including the instruction set architecture, processor state, and processor microarchitecture.

• Learn how to use the Verilog hardware description language to design hardware.

• Learn how to use the open-source FPGA tools to synthesize and load Verilog hardware designs to the iCE40 FPGA.

• Learn how to characterise the performance of a processor design.

• Get first-hand experience in optimizing a processor design with respect to power consumption, performance and resource usage.

• Create new hardware designs in the Verilog hardware description language

• Synthesize Verilog hardware designs to the iCE40 FPGA using open-source FPGA tools.

• Use your understanding of Verilog and the iCE40 FPGA tools to modify the Verilog design of a RISC-V processor design and evaluate it on an FPGA.

• Propose and implement microarchitectural changes to a processor design to improve the performance and resource usage of a processor design.
